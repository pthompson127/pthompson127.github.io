					Pokemon Artificial Intelligence
				</div>
				<div id="project1_description" class="description">
					The summer after my junior year of high school, I wrote a program that could autonomously play Pokemon online with other online users. At the time, I played Pokemon competitively through an online simulator called <a id="showdown_link" href="https://www.pokemonshowdown.com">PokemonShowdown</a>. 
					<br><br>
					I had just begun to scratch the surface of programming through taking AP Computer Science and my summer internship at Boeing so I had limited tools to work with. This project was extremely fun to work on because it taught me how to be resourceful in learning new things. It ultimately influenced my decision to study Computer Science in college.
					<br><br>
					<b>Languages and tools used:</b> Java, HTML, Selenium WebDriver

					Receipt Splitter
				</div>
				<div id="project2_description" class="description">
					This project idea came about during my sophomore year of college. I had just started living in an apartment with a few other friends which means that I had to start grocery shopping. However, splitting the cost started to become a hassle so I used the opportunity during <a id="calhacks_link" href="https://calhacks.io">CalHacks</a> to work on a project that will help my friends and I easily split our grocery costs. 
					<br><br>
					I had so much fun doing this project because my friends and I were able to build it from scratch with the knowledge that I gained through various computer science courses at Berkeley and the Web Design Decal course. Doing projects like these really motivate me to continue pursuing CS and work on projects that can help improve other people's lives.
